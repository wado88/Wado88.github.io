              <h2>Motivation</h2>
              <h3>What is your dataset?</h3>
              <p>
                The dataset we are using is DOHMH_New_York_City_Restaurant_Inspection_Results with is made by
                the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene from New York.
              </p>

              <h3>Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?</h3>
              <p>
                We choose this dataset because it looks interesting and because it had usefuld information
                about the resturants in New York like the score of the different resturants, if they have any critical faults and so on.
              </p>

              <h3>What was your goal for the end user’s experience?</h3>
              <p>
                The goal for the end user was to be able to make a informed decision about with resturant to eat at when
                living in New York or when being a turist in the city.
              </p>

              <h2>Basic stats</h2>

              <h3>Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing</h3>
              <p>
                We have done very little clening of the dataset because we use most of the dataset for one thing or another
                on the webpage but because we had to add some data to the dataset in the form of geocoding by using google.
                Because of time the biggest dataset with geocordinate we have is 40.000 rows but when truing to use this in
                our map it is very slow or realy non responsive so we ented up using a modifieded dataset with 10.000 rows
                randomly selected from the 40.000 rows
              </p>

              <h3>Write a short section that discusses the dataset stats, containing key points/plots from your exploratory data analysis.</h3>
              <p>
                For us the key points in the dataset is the address of the resturant, the score that the resturant godt at the inspection
                and the date that the inspection was performed. Also another point that was important was if a resturant had any critical violation at the inspection time.
              </p>

              <h2>Genre</h2>
              <h3>Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Visual Narrative (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?</h3>
              <p>
                We have the following from the Visual Narrative <br>
                Timebar/timeLine so that it is posible to select the start and end date that the data on the map shows.
              </p>
              <p>
                Feature Distinction because in our map we color the circles with a gradient dependent on the score of the resturants.
                we also use the to indicate the difference boroughs in New York and in our bar plot.
              </p>
              <p>
                Animated Transitions in our map you can brush to select a start and end date that gets updated on the map when you move the brush.
              </p>


              <h3>Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Narrative Structure (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?</h3>
              <p>
                Our webpage is Random Access because the user can access all the information in the way the user wants by scroling up or down
                and because all the information on the webpage is on one page so there is no link to other webpages that contains more information.
              </p>

              <p>
                In our webpage we have Hover Highlighting / Details this can be seen when holding a muse over a circle on the map there is a tooltip
                with information about the specific resturant and if one of the circle is clicked even more information is shown about the resturant
                about where the resturant is located the phone nr. and all the different inspection the resturant has had with what the score was when
                the inspeciton was done. <br>

                On the map there is also a Filtering / Selection option where it is posible to filter the data by what the score is and the date
                it is also posible to select if the circles shown on the map is has critical mistakes or not and more.
              </p>

              <p>
                On the webpage there is headlines and captions to help the user in what the different part of the figures represent and there
                is also some text presentation the different part of the webpage.
              </p>

              <h2>Visualizations</h2>
              <h3>Explain the visualizations you’ve chosen.</h3>
              <p>
                we have chosen the following visualizations first we have a bar chart then a map with a timeline and at table to help
                give all the information to the user.
              </p>

              <h3>Why are they right for the story you want to tell?</h3>
              <p>
                We have chosen to do a bar chart in the start to get a overview of the area New York then we have a map with a timeline and
                to filters where the timeline filter the dates that the different inspection on the map have and the next filter filters the
                score shown on the map and last filter you can select if the data should include all types of flags or only critical,
                not critical or not applicable. last we have a table with information on the circle in the map that is clicked on this
                include all inspection for the respective resturant with the inspection date, the violation description, the score
                and whether it was critical or not.
              </p>

              <h2>Discussion</h2>
              <h3>What went well?,</h3>
              <p>
                the implementation of the map with timeline was the best because we aready have experience in making a map from previus assignment.
              </p>

              <h3>What is still missing? What could be improved?, Why?</h3>
              <p>
                zoom on the map is not working so has been out commented one of the reasons way it is not working is when zooming in on the map the circles increases in size
                and implementation of some natigation on the map when zoom works so that it is posible to move the view. <br>
                The thinks that could be improved is the performance of the webpage this could be done by having
                dedicated datasets for specific parts of the visualisation that then could base formated in a way that allow fast search for different
                tings dependent on what it is uses for. One case where this could be usefull would be in combination with the map where all the data
                use directly in the map be in one dataset and when clicking on a circle then use another dataset that is sorted after the camis nr.
                to find all occurrences of the specific resturant this would be done by a binary seach where in our current method we have to search the entire dataset through
                to find all the inspection of the resturant. <br>
                Another way to get bedder performance is by using a database so that seaching for information is fast. The last thing we have consitered that could be improved is to add more filters to the map
              </p>

              <h3>You should write (just briefly) which group member was the main responsible for which elements of the assignment.
                (I want you guys to understand every part of the assignment, but usually there is someone who took lead role on certain
                portions of the work. That’s what you should explain).</h3>
